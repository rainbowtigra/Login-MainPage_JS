1. Create product listing page
Use app/index.html file
Create a full width page with a header, a footer and a main section in index.html.
Main section should be populated with products using AJAX - data set src/data/products.json
Each product should include image thumbnail, product name, product price (current, was and discount price), size and be linked to url key
Add Favourite icon to each product
Desktop design for products layout is provided in app/plp-design.png
It should be fully responsive
Add toggle option between list and grid view
Add comments on what other improvements would you add to this page
Optional task: The data set is reasonably large so we need to be able to: filter the data by: category, price, size and sort the data by: price (ascending), price (descending) and name (ascending)

2. Form Validation
Use app/form.html file
Add a form with following fields:
name: text only, no case sensitive
surname: text only, no case sensitive
email: alphanumeric, no case sensitive must contain @ symbol and domain name
phone: can contain + (only in front of the number) and space characters and numbers only
password: must be at least 8 long and contain at least 1 special character
Display error messages for each invalid field
All fields are required and needs to be valid before form can be submitted
Use only vanilla JS for this tasks (do not use plugins or HTML5 API)
Optional task: add unit tests
